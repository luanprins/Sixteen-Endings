A text-based adventure with sixteen endings to a gory, humorous storyline – collect them all!

This game is about seeing how far branching story paths can be taken.

Absurdly subtle changes in choice have immense gravity in the storyline. It is both an ode to, and satire of, games emphasizing player choice, like The Stanley Parable meets
The Walking Dead.

HOW TO PLAY

Currently, running the script requires Python to be installed on your machine.

Then just run the main file making sure to have the accompanying Dimensions folder in the same directory.
